3. sumOfTwoBits() - This method returns the string value of the final result generated by the half adder circuit.
4. printAddResult() - This method prints well formatted result for the addition.
5. getHalfAdderDiagram() - This method returns a string containing a formatted half adder diagram for the addition.
6. printHalfAdderTruthTable() - This method prints the truth table for all possible input values to the half adder circuit.

*NotBinaryDigitException* Class :-
